The Odin Project - Landing Page Project

This is the second project in the Foundations section of The Odin Project. The task is to build a web page from a design provided and practice the HTML and CSS concepts I have learned so far. The finished product should look similar to this: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png.
